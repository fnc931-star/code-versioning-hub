# 🌸 My First Git & GitHub Learning Repository

### 🧠 About This Project

Hi there! 👋  

I’ve recently started my **Git and GitHub learning journey** through the **Codex platform**, and this is my **first learning repository**.  
It’s where I’m exploring the basics of **version control** — learning how to track changes, manage commits, and collaborate effectively.  
You can check out my learning progress on Codex here:

### 💬 What This Repository Contains
This project includes two Python files:  
- `first_meet.py`  
- `main.py`  

In the first file, I created a simple **`chit_chat`** function that starts with a friendly greeting — just a small beginning, but a meaningful one.  
It’s designed to recognize names and respond warmly, and I plan to turn it into a **real-time chat bot** in the future.

The second file runs that function and acts as the **main entry point** for the program.  
I’ve learned how to properly use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement — a small but important step in Python programming.

### 🌱 My Learning Journey
This repository represents my very first step into the world of coding and version control.  
It might be simple, but for me, it’s like a **toddler’s first steps** — small yet full of excitement and curiosity.  
I’ll keep improving the project as I learn more about Git, GitHub, and Python.

### 🚀 What’s Next
- Keep experimenting with commits, branches, and merges  
- Upgrade the chat bot with real-time responses  
- Add more documentation and practice collaboration
